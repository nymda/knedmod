# KnedMod - a sandbox oriented mod for teardown

The main purpose of KnedMod is to give you a spawn menu within teardown that can be used to dynamically add new objects to the world. 
It also adds a toolgun with various functions and a noclip mode.
This is considered far from a complete project and has a lot of known bugs that can cause crashes, however i feel it is a good resource for anyone attempting to make their own mod. 

Building requires MS Detours and GLEW. KnedMod is released under the GNU GPL v3 license.
